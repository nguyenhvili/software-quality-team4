# Access system without logging in user story

As a user, I want to access the system without providing any credentials, so that I can use it without creating or managing an account.

## Acceptance criteria

-   The system is accessible locally in a web browser without prompting for credentials.
-   No user registration or sign-in is required to interact with the system.
-   There are no permissions or role-based access, as I am the system's only user.

## Out of scope

-   User authentication and authorization.
-   User management and account creation.
-   User roles and permissions.
-   Multi-user support.
-   Deployment in shared/public environments.

## Notes

-   This setup assumes a single-user, private environment.

## Estimation

-   Minimal effort, since no authentication or authorization is required.

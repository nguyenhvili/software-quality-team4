# User Story: Automate Report Sending

## Description
As an user (admin), I want the system to automatically distribute reports to all recipients simultaneously, so that I don't have to send them individually.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system sends latest report to all recipients email addresses.
- If the email sending fails, the system logs an error and the user is notified.

## Notes
- The recipients list is maintained and defined elsewhere in the system.
